# CMM3111 - Big Data Analytics

***This project follows a systematic data-science driven approach to build and evaluate a data-driven solution using Supervised Machine Learning***

### The Jupyter notebook is structured based on the following tasks:
  1. Research & Data Exploration:
     - Select a dataset related to a real-world problem
     - Exploratory data analysis & data pre-processing (missing values, outliers, etc.)
  2. Modelling / Classification
     - Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets
     - Build the classification model to classify / predict class labels
     - Test and evaluate model performance
     - Report, discuss and interpret results
  3. Solution Improvement
     - Create and evaluate different models
     - Change the partitioning of the dataset (e.g.: oversampling for class imbalance)
     - Hyperparameter tuning
